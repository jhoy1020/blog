## Description

This projects intention was a way to put in play concepts and tech that I wanted to gain more exposure to. It is still a work in progress and is changing frequently... when I find the time.

This is a client application written in Typescript using the React framework. It queries a rest api which is located in my blogApi repo. It is pretty basic and will list posts, show the post details, allows users to submit comments (they need to first login with their github creds), and send emails via the contact page. This site is 100% over kill... and did not have to be this complex. However, again, the purpose was to learn new concepts and get familiar to tech I haven't had a chance to use.
